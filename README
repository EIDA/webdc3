IDEAS for version 2.0
=====================

* Cookie to come back to a half-built search.
 (e.g. save a station set, update the events associated with it)

* GFZ event pages have a link to go straight to waveform selection

* Add search by QC parameters, etc.

* :event: *important* Filter by station distance

* :event: Circular filter of the catalog.

* und viel mehr... see TODO
