Configuration options for webinterface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This refers specificially to the WSGI application providing web services.
See also JavaScript documentation elsewhere??

.. note ::
   This file is used with `webinterface.xml` for magical
   configuration documentation generation. Much more to do.
