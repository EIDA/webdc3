station.js menu - null item for replace().  [Helle P, 2013-09-09]

doesn't work in Opera [PLE, August 2013]

Things that need fixing in the short term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adjust time span for stations if events are given and 'search by events'.

* Event pull-downs should be 1980 to current year.

* Events: maximum magnitude option on the web page [JC]

* Events: display the type of magnitude, if one is available [JC]

* Install procedure wasn't smooth, if the final URL is other than /webinterface

* Documentation:
   - all tutorial items need to work.
   - developer notes clean-up.
   - configuration parameter documentation.

* Dependency on seiscomp/manager.py - what can we do to ease that?

* beta testing on some users. (In progress, Aug-Sep 2013)

* The shrink/reduce/refine/delete feature:
	request.js - Pack._event_list

* Logging needs to be turned down. DONE

* :event: Implement ISC catalog - example URL is
http://www.isc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/web-db-v4?request=COMPREHENSIVE&out_format=CATCSV&searchshape=RECT&bot_lat=0&top_lat=50&left_lon=-30&right_lon=30&ctr_lat=&ctr_lon=&radius=&max_dist_units=deg&srn=&grn=&start_year=2013&start_month=2&start_day=28&start_time=00%3A00%3A00&end_year=2013&end_month=3&end_day=01&end_time=00%3A00%3A00&min_dep=&max_dep=&min_mag=&max_mag=&req_mag_type=Any&req_mag_agcy=Any&include_links=on

* :event: Read QuakeML e.g. from fdsnws-event

* :event: Using parse for event catalog - depths are lost again.
	- also show a pop-up/console warning if NOTHING was readable.

* Add webdc.html DONE and basic.html examples.
	- ln -s generic.html index.html
	- can we move webdc.html and basic.html to examples?
	- can we use current openlayers with the webdc.html example?

* Advanced stream filter - what???

* :event/station: Add/trim/filter already-chosen events/stations

* :event: Don't create temp files!

* :event: GFZ service - don't allow before 1 August 2007.

* :event: Still a limit problem - 2x nmax=... on parameters

* :event: Upload - popup should report accepted, nnn events loaded, separator was, or zero, see console.

* :view: Should be viewable with JavaScript disabled

* :event: Circular regions

* :metadata: Check parameters or raise WIError.

* :metadata: add JQ's test cases

* :metadata: query doesn't respect targetsps parameter.

* Better treatment of static content, 'favicon.ico' etc.

* Mapping/station list: show start and end dates, for temporary stations,
  on the list and/or on their map pop-ups.

* :mapping: Colour code events by magnitude/depth

* :python: Log to [wsgi.error] or whatever it's called. DONE?

Hinted-at features (2013-09-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Including support for different waveform parameters
   e.g. qc, ground motion parameters.

* Providing download of the station/stream lists, and
  supporting selection by uploading such a list.
  WH: "Making station/stream lists extendable and providing a download/upload option for these lists to make them re-usable and modifiable."

* "Circular" region selection as well as "rectangular"
   (latitude/longitude boxes).

* Flexible system of colouring schemes for events.
  (depth and magnitude dependent)

* "Full screen" mode where the map is larger for
   better browsing.

* Warn if the 800 event limit is hit.

Important in the medium term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :event: Save/download an event list

* :metadata: Upload and Save/download a station list

* Filter station-event pairs by azimuth/backazimuth/distance [FT, Dec 2013]
  and/or "station-first" selection: first a station, then appropriate events.

"Requirements" that are still not implemented
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Look up by strong motion data or QC parameters.


Nice to have features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Produce KML files for station and event lists. [JC, 24 Sept.]

* DONE? Break up big requests (1000s of lines) into chunks and manage them.

* Relate present webdc.eu web server stats to user actions:
 - are user requests typically event-based or station-based?

* Richer list of symbols for different event magnitudes/depths,
  and use subimages from a symbol sheet.

* Time window computation: specifying a constant speed/slowness to be
used with the source-receiver distance, or use OT.



Known Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Doesn't run over nx?

Doesn't work on Internet Explorer x.x properly.

Doesn't work on Opera/Konqueror properly??

Isn't properly relocatable? URL should be independent of location in the file system.

SERVER_FOLDER to server.dir

Some event-related things that still need doing:

* TODO Jul 2 - clipping by radius
* TODO Jul 2 - clipping by azimuth

* TODO July 4 - start on implementing parse POST method for CSV file input
* Reopen/no temp files - partly done, could be better.
* TODO Jul 10 - Filtering for params unimplemented in target service
	e.g. circular regions
	e.g. depth (for eqinfo)
* TODO Jul 10 - missing data test case can be in EventData class
* DONE Dateline crossing tests.
* Clean up EventServices code
  ...in progress, uses WI_Module class.
* TODO Name space - Event* classes to WI_Event*

* June  - where is the 404 page for URLs below /event now?
* TODO Review add event service procedure - use FDSNWS case as test
* DONE :important: EMSC catalog
* NOT NEEDED Build lite JavaScript reader/displayer for presentation side.

* TODO Get configuration sorted out 				  :important:
  event.services.catalog
  event.service.[which].descriptions, capabilities ??

* DONE Filter by depth and magnitude in eqinfo
* Accept QuakeML input 				:useful:
* Produce QuakeML output 				:unimportant: 

* Oops: QUERY_STRING parameters get re-ordered from original request!  :unimportant:
* :NOTE: obspy.neries and obspy.(iris fdsn ws) exist !
